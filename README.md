## Notification structure
- We used 2 plugins for schedule notification to alert user:
  - flutter_local_notifications: ^14.1.1
  - date_field: ^3.0.5
- Task we should do:
  - Initialize a plugin instance with android and iOS notification settings
  - Initialize the time zones
  - Create select notification action(Ex: â€” navigate to a specific page)
  - Request iOS permission
  - In this case schedule a notification
  - add the method to show notifications
